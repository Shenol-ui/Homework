            I was born on January 2nd, 2005, in Skopje, and grew up in Debar, more specifically, I grew up in the small village of Dzhepishte, just south of Debar. I attended "High School 28th of November" where I developed a keen interest in technology and computers. This passion led me to pursue higher education in computer science.
